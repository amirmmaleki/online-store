# Project Overview

## Summary
I started by using **Canva** to extract and separate problematic parts of the code. The JavaScript was moved into dedicated files for better organization and maintainability.

Since Canva included some redundant or unnecessary code, I used **ChatGPT** to simplify and optimize it, making the code cleaner, more concise, and easier to understand.

Each section of the code is annotated with comments explaining its purpose, helping users quickly grasp what each part does.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Loading Indicator Issue**: Initially, the loading spinner was not displaying correctly during user searches. With the assistance of ChatGPT, I fixed this issue by adjusting the relevant JavaScript code.
- **Code Optimization**: After several days of iterations, the codebase became more efficient and maintainable.

## Final Improvements
- Optimized `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
- Reduced repository size by managing the `node_modules` folder effectively.
